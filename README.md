# Bike Sales Analysis Dashboard in Excel

### **Overview**

This project explores customer data to identify patterns in bike purchases. Using Excel, we cleaned the dataset, built pivot tables, and created an interactive dashboard to highlight key insights into customer demographics and buying behaviors.

### **Goals and Key Questions**

- What factors influence bike purchases? (e.g., income, age, commute distance)
- Do higher-income individuals buy bikes more often?
- How does age impact purchasing decisions?
- What is the relationship between commute distance and bike ownership?

### **Dataset**

The dataset used in this analysis is available on Kaggle: [Bike Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedmohamedibrahim1/bike-sales-dataset). It contains customer demographic details, income levels, commuting habits, and bike purchase decisions, providing a strong foundation for analysis.

### **Data Cleaning and Preparation**

- Removed duplicates to maintain data accuracy.
- Standardized categorical data (e.g., changing “M” to “Male”).
- Created age brackets to simplify analysis and improve readability.
- Formatted numerical values to ensure currency data was consistent.

### **Methodology**

- **Pivot Tables:** Used to summarize and analyze data.
- **Calculated Fields:** Created new variables, such as age ranges, for better categorization.
- **Interactive Filters (Slicers):** Added filters for marital status, region, and education to allow deeper insights.
- **Dashboard Design:** Organized for clarity, with key visualizations placed strategically.

### **Key Insights**

- **Income Levels:** Higher-income individuals are more likely to purchase bikes.
- **Age Trends:** Middle-aged adults (31-54) buy the most bikes, while younger (0-30) and older (55+) individuals purchase fewer.
- **Commute Distance:** Customers who commute shorter distances (0-1 miles) are more likely to buy bikes.

### **Limitations**

- **Data Source:** The dataset may not fully represent all consumer behaviors, limiting its broader applicability.
- **Limited Variables:** Factors like personal preferences and environmental concerns were not included.
- **Excel Constraints:** While Excel is powerful, it has limitations when handling large datasets and advanced predictive modeling.

### **Future Recommendations**

- **Expand Data Collection:** Include variables such as lifestyle habits and environmental concerns for a more comprehensive analysis.
- **Use Advanced Analytics:** Implement machine learning models in Python or R to gain predictive insights.
- **Enhance Dashboard Usability:** Improve interactivity using tools like Tableau or Power BI for a more user-friendly experience.

### **Usage Instructions**

- **Filters:** Use slicers to explore data based on marital status, region, and education level.
- **Pivot Tables:** Modify to uncover additional insights.
- **Viewing the Dashboard:** The final dashboard is available in the Excel file.
